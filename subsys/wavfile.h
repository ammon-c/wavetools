// wavfile.h
//
// C++ module to read and write Microsoft WAV audio files.
// This is older code that has been modified several times over
// the years.  It isn't quite as shiny as new code would be.
//
// Note this module intentionally doesn't use any definitions from
// windows.h so we can avoid including it here.
//
// Limitations:
//
// * Only supports raw PCM audio formats, including 8-bit
//   unsigned integer samples, 16-bit signed integer samples,
//   and 32-bit floating-point samples.  Doesn't currently
//   support compressed or adaptive formats.
//
// * When reading WAV files, assumes there are no extra RIFF
//   chunks or padding byte between the file header, the format
//   header, and the audio data.
